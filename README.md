## Game of Thrones Death Board ⚔️

Inspired by "The Battle of Winterfell" (S8E3) of Game of Thrones, the death board allows users to select who they think will die in the battle. A working link can be found at https://gameofthronesdeathboard.netlify.com/

### Walk through

Users enter their names in the form input field. They're then taken to a page with 9 boxes. Each box contains a dropdown menu with a list of character names. Select one character per box. Once all 9 boxes are filled you can submit your selections. 

The next screen then allows you to tap on a character to confirm their death. This action brings up a ⚰️ emoji on that characters name. 

Playing along with friends the aim of the game is tic tac toe style; whoever gets 3 boxes in a row of confirmed deaths wins.
